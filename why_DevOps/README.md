# what is DevOps

- Combination of development and operations 
- Bridges the gap, Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer in siloes
- engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.
- These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow, to deliver applications and services at high velocity.


# Why

- Software no longer merely supports a business; rather it becomes an integral component of every part of a business
- software can now be able to increase operational effeciency by automating every part of the value chain: logistics, communications etc
- software development and infrastructure management processes can now be streamlined, for example by making frequent small updates

# Practices

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Microservices
- Infrastructure as code
- Monitoring and logging
- Communication and collaboration
