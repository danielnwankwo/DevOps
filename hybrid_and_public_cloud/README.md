# Cloud

## On Prem:

- hosting the database on site, where the owner of the hardware has full control

## Hybrid Cloud:

- mixed computing, storage, and services environment made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud—such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure

## Public cloud 

- essentially renting a slice of their distributed data center infrastructure
- Public clouds deliver cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- hey offer massive economies of scale, scale elastically, and run fully automated, so it’s nearly impossible for an on-premises data center to compete on price or efficiency≈
